# Node.js Demo App with Automated CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a simple Node.js application combined with a CI/CD pipeline, built as part of my internship learning project to understand modern development and deployment practices.

## My Learning Journey and Accomplishments

During this internship task, I focused on several key areas to deepen my understanding of software development workflows:

### 1. Building a Sample Node.js Application  
Create a Demo React App locally and pushed it to the remote repo

### 2. Dockerizing the Application  
I learned how to write a Dockerfile to containerize the app, which ensures a consistent environment for running the application regardless of where it is deployed. This was an important introduction to containerization concepts.

### 3. Automating Builds and Testing with GitHub Actions  
I set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate:
- Installing dependencies
- Running unit tests
This step solidified my understanding of Continuous Integration (CI) and why automated testing matters.

### 4. Building and Pushing Docker Images Automatically  
I configured the pipeline to build Docker images and push them to DockerHub whenever new code is merged to the main branch. This automation demonstrated Continuous Deployment (CD) best practices.

### 5. Managing Secrets Safely  
I learned how to manage sensitive information like DockerHub credentials securely using GitHub Secrets, avoiding hardcoded passwords and improving the security of the pipeline.

### 6. Troubleshooting and Best Practices  
Encountering issues such as Dockerfile location errors helped me understand the importance of project structure and workflow configuration and equipped me with effective debugging skills.

This project represents an important milestone in my internship, demonstrating my growing ability to develop, containerize, and deploy applications in an automated and professional manner.

Feel free to explore this repository and see the practical side of CI/CD integration with containerization.
